## About this repository

This repository is created intended for review and practice of JavaScript Basics

The key learning points in the module are:

1. You need two things to run a JS code– a web browser and a code editor. The two common code editors are Visual Studio Code and Repl. it.
2. Variables are used to store and retrieve data from memory. A variable has a name and value.
3. The semi-colon (;) is used to close a sentence; its use is not mandatory but highly recommended.
4. There are different types of conditional statements in JavaScript, including: "If" statements (if a condition is true, it is used to specify execution for a block of code), "Else" statements (if the same condition is false, it specifies the execution for a block of code), "Else if" statements (specifies a new test if the first condition is false).
5. Comparison operators allow us to compare variables in different ways. They allow for rich and complex logic when used with "if" and "else" statements.
6. Comparison operator, equal is donated by == and not equal is donated by !=.
7. Boolean variables are variables with true or false values. Boolean operators are AND, OR and NOT.
8. Functions are procedures that can be executed multiple times, and they help in code organisation, less repetition and better readability.
9. Objects are data structures that allow you to store multiple properties and more complex entities in a single variable.
10. Methods are object properties that are functions that can be executed.
11. Loops are iterations that allow you to execute any action multiple times without repetition.
12. Continue and Break are keys to continuing the flow inside a loop and allowing to pause or exit the loop.
13. Loops can be created in JavaScript and are common in many other programming languages.
14. Arrays are collections of items that have a particular order. The first item in an array is at position 'zero', and the last item in the array is at position– 'length of the array minus 1'.
15. An array that contains others arrays is called a multidimensional array.
16. DOM is Document Object Model. It is the JavaScript representation of the HTML document used to create interactivity.
